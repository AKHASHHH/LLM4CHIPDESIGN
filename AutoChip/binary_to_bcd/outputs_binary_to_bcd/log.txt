system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: /*
Create a Verilog module named top_module that is compatible with iverilog. 

The module should have a 5-bit input, binary_input, to handle values from 0 to 31. 
It must also have an 8-bit output, bcd_output, where the most significant nibble (bits 7 down to 4) represents the tens digit and the least significant nibble (bits 3 down to 0) represents the units digit of the decimal equivalent.

The implementation should use division and modulo operations to perform the conversion. 
The intermediate results should be assigned to wires, and the final bcd_output should be a concatenation of the lower 4 bits of the tens and units wires.

The module declaration should be as follows:
*/

module top_module (
    input  [4:0] binary_input,
    output [7:0] bcd_output
);

// Module body goes here

endmodule
assistant: module top_module (
    input  [4:0] binary_input,
    output [7:0] bcd_output
);

// Wires to hold the intermediate results of the conversion
wire [3:0] tens;
wire [3:0] units;

// Calculate tens and units using division and modulo operations
assign tens = binary_input / 10;
assign units = binary_input % 10;

// Concatenate tens and units to form the final BCD output
assign bcd_output = {tens, units};

endmodule
